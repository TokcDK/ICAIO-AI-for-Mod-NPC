ICAIO AI for Modded NPCs

CAUTION: This patcher is untested outside of my own game. Use it at your own risk, and please send me a bug report if you encounter are any issues.

This patcher is for users of Immersive Citizens AI Overhaul (ICAIO), not AI Overhaul.

ICAIO generally uses quests to distribute its AI Packages through quests. These quests distribute specific AI Packages for specific NPCs as well as having several "slots" for other NPCs that may be in the same area. Unfortunately, these slots are limited, and some NPCs may be missed if your game is heavily modified. This patcher tries to rectify this by giving mod-added NPCs the AI and combat packages that they would normally recieve from ICAIO's quests. Then it gives them the ICAIOExclusionFaction so that they are not picked up by the quests. This extends ICAIO's AI to mod-added NPCs, while keeping the quest slots open for any generic NPCs that may happen into the area. Generally, this means that NPCs will go inside during rainy weather, or run away during dragon and vampire attacks.

I have been unable to find testers for this patcher, so for the time being, please use this patcher at your own risk. If you have a minimally modded game, this patcher will likely not do much, but if you have a lot of additional NPCs, this should make sure that they all act accordingly. I'd appreciate any feedback you might have.
